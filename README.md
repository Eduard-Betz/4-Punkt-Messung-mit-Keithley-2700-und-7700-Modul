• pandas (pip install pandas)
• openpyxl (pip install openpyxl)

This is a program to measure boards with one or more resistors on a single board. All resistors are measured using a 4-point probe.
The program can convert PT100, PT500, and PT1000 resistors into temperature values (in °C).

Each resistor measurement is saved into a CSV data file and can be loaded later for further analysis.
